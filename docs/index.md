My [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/craigpastro/).

- I used to like Ruby a lot, so I did a bunch with Ruby. It's a good language
  for leetcode, but in general I prefer languages with an "only one way to do
  things" philosophy.
- I like Go, so I did a bunch with Go.
- Recently I tried to do a bunch with Python. I've come to the conclusion that
  Python is probably the best language for leetcoding. All the solutions here
  are in Python.

You can see some of the older Ruby and Go solutions in the
[repo](https://github.com/craigpastro/leetcode).
