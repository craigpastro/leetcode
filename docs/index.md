# Leetcode Solutions

My [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/craigpastro/).

- I used to like Ruby a lot, so I did a bunch with Ruby. It's a good language for leetcode, but in general I prefer languages with an "only one way to do things" philosophy. 
- I like Go, so I did a bunch with Go.
- Recently I tried to do a bunch with Python. I've come to the conclusion that Python is probably the best language for leetcoding. All the solutions here are in Python.

You can see some of the older Ruby and Go solutions at the [repo](https://github.com/craigpastro/leetcode).
