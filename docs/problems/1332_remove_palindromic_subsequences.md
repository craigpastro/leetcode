# 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Easy

You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single
step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some
characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence
does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as
forward.

#### Craig's notes

- If the input is not a palindrome, then we can do it in two steps by deleting
  all 'a's, then deleting all 'b's.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

#### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            if s[l] == s[r]:
                l += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                return 2
    
        return 1
```
