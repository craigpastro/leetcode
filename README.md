# Leetcode solutions

My [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/craigpastro/).

- I used to like Ruby a lot, so I did a bunch with [Ruby](./ruby). It's a good language for leetcode, but in general I prefer languages with an "only one way to do things" philosophy. 
- I like Go, so I did a bunch with [Go](./go).
- Recently I tried to do a bunch with [Python](./python). I've come to the conclusion that Python is probably the best language for leetcoding.
